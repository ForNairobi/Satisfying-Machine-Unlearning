# Satisfying-Machine-Unlearning

The code of the Stackelberg game model in the manuscript "Satisfying Machine Unlearning" that is submitted to the ICDE 2024.
Profits.m (Fig. 3) describes the service provider's profit and customers' optimal solution.
convex.m is the function for the convex optimisation
con_cal.m is for calculating the service provider's optimal result considering customers' optimal solution. Results of iterations are required.

Please note that all results are collected manually and sorted to the following resutls:
convergence.m (Fig. 4) shows the convergence process.
Demand1_n.m (Fig. 5) shows the influence of fitting parameter \phi on the optimal results of the number of requests 
Demand1_p.m (Fig. 6) shows the influence of fitting parameter \phi on the optimal price
Demand2_n.m (Fig. 7) shows the influence of fitting parameter \kappa on the optimal results of the number of requests
Demand2_p.m (Fig. 8) shows the influence of fitting parameter \kappa on the optimal price
